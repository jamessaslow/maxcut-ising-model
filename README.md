# Examining Macroscopic Thermal Behaviors of Maximum Cut Mapped to the Ising Model
### James Saslow, Kyle Nguyen


This was a midterm project for my Quantum Many Body Physics course during the Fall 2024 semester as part of my MS Quantum Technology curriculum. Here, we solve the max cut problem by mapping it to an Ising Hamiltonian and solve the cost function via quantum annealing. We noticed that we could reliably solve maxcut for some interval of temperature less than the critical temperature of the Ising lattice. We explored how different random seeds of maxcut cost functions could impact the critical temperature and other macroscopic thermal properties of the ising lattice.
